# Pywalfox

Pywalfox allows Firefox to be themed using Pywal. It also includes custom CSS that adds things such as a thin scrollbar, smaller and bold text, styled dropdowns, etc.

The addon is using the new Theme API to dynamically change colors in a more efficient and future-proof way.

The custom CSS is optional and can be enabled/disabled from within the extension (there may be some issues if you have multiple profiles in firefox).
You also have to enable the support for custom CSS for it to work. How to do this is described down below.

### Warning
The layout presented in the screenshots with the bookmarks to the right of the URL-bar is simply my preferred layout. You are free to use whatever you like.

Pywalfox is quite new and not fully polished, so you can expect some issues in styling/readability in some shape or form. It has also only been tested on two different machines running Arch Linux and very similiar setups, so things may not work as expected for you out of the box. Feel free to create an issue/pull request for any issues you may have.

### Installation
Clone the repo and navigate to `pywalfox/native-app` and run `bash setup.sh`. It will require sudo access, since the path in which we need to place the native app manifest is protected by default. Firefox requires said manifest to allow communication between the addon and the script running on your system.
Make sure to run the script from within the `native-app` folder, or you will get errors.

If everything goes as planned, it should look something like this:
```
Creating 'native-messaging-hosts' folder in ~/.mozilla
Setting path to pywal-fetcher.py in the native app manifest
Copying native application manifest to ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hostst/pywalfox.json
Setting execution permissions on daemon (pywal-fetcher.py)
Finished.
```

When this is done, you should be able to set the theme using the addon.

### Custom CSS, userChrome.css and userContent.css
If you want to use the custom CSS, you must do the following:
1. Open `about:config` in Firefox
2. Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`

### Troubleshooting
* Make sure that `path` in `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hostst/pywalfox.json` points to the location of `native-app/pywal-fetcher.py`
* Make sure that `pywal-fetcher.py` is executable (`chmod +x pywal-fetcher.py`)
* Make sure that the file `~/.cache/wal/colors` exists and contains the colors generated by pywal
* Take a look at the Browser console (`Tools > Web developer > Browser console`) for errors
